I created these code-templates for a Hyper Island project during my studies as a Digital Data Strategist. My team and I had to create a website in order to be viral within 4 days. My team decided to create a funky quiz: http://swedenordenmark.com/

These are the prospective templates I created using HTML & CSS for the page that display the questions
and the last page that display the score and the quiz results. 
I also handled the copywriting and the content management.
